This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in Expo's Image component.  The issue involves an image failing to load without providing any informative error messages in the console. The `brokenImage.js` file showcases the problem, while `fixedImage.js` presents the solution.  The bug often stems from issues with the image URI, network connectivity, or caching mechanisms within the Expo environment.  The solution focuses on robust URI handling and error checking to prevent silent failures.
